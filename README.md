# üßæ InvoSight ‚Äì AI-Powered Invoice Data Extractor

**InvoSight** is a lightweight and intelligent web application that extracts structured data from invoices in PDF or image formats. It supports OCR-based extraction using both standard Tesseract OCR and Groq's powerful vision-language model (LLaMA). Outputs are presented in JSON format and downloadable as CSV or Excel.

## üîç Features

- ‚úÖ Upload invoice files (PDF, PNG, JPG, WEBP)
- ‚úÖ Choose between **Normal OCR (Tesseract)** or **Groq OCR (LLaMA VLM)**
- ‚úÖ Handles both structured and unstructured invoices
- ‚úÖ Auto-detects PDF type (readable vs scanned)
- ‚úÖ Displays extracted JSON output
- ‚úÖ Download result as **CSV** or **Excel (.xlsx)**

## üéØ Objective

Build an AI system that automatically reads scanned or digital invoices (PDFs/images) from various vendors with different layouts and extracts structured expense information for further processing, analytics, or storage.

---

## üìÇ Supported Formats

- Scanned PDF invoice documents

- PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP receipt with tabular billing

- WEBP format digital invoice

- Multi-vendor unstructured PDFs

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Upload an invoice** (image or PDF)
2. **Choose extraction method**:
   - `Normal OCR`: Tesseract-based optical character recognition
   - `Groq OCR`: Uses Groq's LLaMA-based multimodal vision model via API
3. **View JSON Output**
4. **Download** as `.csv` or `.xlsx`
